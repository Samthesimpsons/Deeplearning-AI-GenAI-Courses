# Short Course: Large Language Model Fine-Tuning

In this short course, you will learn essential fine-tuning concepts and how to train a large language model using your own data. You will be equipped to incorporate the latest techniques to optimize your model and produce transformative results.

Upon completing this course, you will be able to:

- Understand when to apply fine-tuning on Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Prepare your data for fine-tuning.
- Train and evaluate an LLM on your data.

With fine-tuning, you can take your own data to train the model, updating the weights of the neural nets in the LLM. This process allows you to change the model compared to other methods like prompt engineering and Retrieval Augmented Generation. Fine-tuning enables the model to learn style, form, and can update the model with new knowledge to improve results.
